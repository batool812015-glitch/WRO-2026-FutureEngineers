## 💻 Software

### Architecture

```
ESP32 (C++ / Arduino Framework)
────────────────────────────────
main.cpp              — Main control loop
motor_control.cpp     — L298N + DC Motor
servo_control.cpp     — MG996R steering
imu_reader.cpp        — MPU-6050 yaw reading
tof_sensors.cpp       — VL53L1X wall following
color_detection.cpp   — TCS3472 line detection
lap_counter.cpp       — Turn counting logic
```

### Communication Protocol

All sensors communicate with ESP32 via I2C bus (GPIO 21, 22).
Motor and servo receive PWM signals directly from ESP32 GPIO pins.

### Core Algorithm

```cpp
while (lapCount < 3) {
  String color = getColor();         // TCS3472 reads floor color

  if (color == "ORANGE" || color == "BLUE") {
    detectDirection(color);           // First turn determines direction
    turn90degrees();                  // MPU-6050 ensures ±2° accuracy
    lapCount += 0.25;                // 4 turns = 1 complete lap
  } else {
    int error = tofLeft - tofRight;  // Wall following error
    int steer = error * Kp;          // PID steering correction
    setMotor(BASE_SPEED, steer);
  }
}
```

### Dependencies

```
C++ (ESP32 Arduino Framework):
- Wire.h               — I2C communication
- ESP32Servo           — Servo control
- Adafruit_VL53L1X    — ToF distance sensors
- MPU6050              — by ElectronicCats
- Adafruit_TCS34725   — Color sensor
```

## 🏁 Open Challenge

### Strategy

The robot completes 3 full laps autonomously:

1. **Straights:** Dual ToF sensors maintain equal distance from both walls
2. **Turn Detection:** Color sensor detects orange/blue lines ~5cm ahead
3. **Turn Execution:** IMU rotates exactly 90° with ±2° precision
4. **Lap Counting:** Every 4 turns = 1 complete lap → stop at 12 turns

### Results

| Attempt | Time | Errors | Notes |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| Run 1 | — | — | — |
| Run 2 | — | — | — |
| Run 3 | — | — | — |

## 🚧 Obstacle Challenge

*(In development — Phase 2)*

Strategy will involve:
- Camera-based color detection for red/green pillars
- Left/right avoidance logic based on pillar color
- Parallel parking in the final zone

## 📖 Engineering Journal

> **This is what separates us from other teams.**
> We document everything — including failures and what we learned from them.

### [2026-05-18] — Day 0: Team Meeting & Planning

**What we did:**
- Met with coach to understand WRO 2026 requirements
- Studied the rulebook together
- Planned robot architecture from scratch

**Key decisions:**
- Split responsibilities: Batool → Software, Sara → Hardware & Firmware
- Sensor plan: ToF x2 (wall following), IMU (turns), Color Sensor (lines)
- Camera needed for Obstacle Challenge — planned for Phase 2

---

### [2026-05-24] — Day 1: Shopping & Component Selection

**What we did:**
- Visited electronics store and purchased all components
- Researched and selected sensors

**Key decisions:**

1. **IMU: BNO085 → MPU-6050**
   - Originally planned BNO085 (9-DOF, near-zero drift)
   - Found MPU-6050 locally at lower cost
   - Analysis: competition runs ~3 min, MPU-6050 drift negligible
   - Decision: MPU-6050 accepted ✅

2. **No Encoder Motor**
   - IMU-based turn counting sufficient (4 turns = 1 lap)
   - Reduces cost and complexity

3. **Open Challenge First Strategy**
   - Raspberry Pi not available yet
   - ESP32 + sensors sufficient for Open Challenge
   - Staged approach reduces risk

**Components purchased:**
- ESP32, VL53L1X x2, MPU-6050, TCS3472
- RC Ackermann Chassis Kit (RoboticX)
- L298N Motor Driver, LiPo Battery
- MG996R Servo, XL6009E1 Step-down
- Breadboard + jumper wires

---

### [2026-05-25] — Day 2: Chassis Assembly

**What we did:**
- Assembled RC Ackermann chassis completely
- Disassembled gearbox to count gear teeth for gear ratio calculation
- Soldered sensor connections
- Photographed all assembly steps

**What worked:**
- Chassis assembled successfully
- Ackermann steering mechanism works smoothly

**Next session:**
- Connect ESP32 to motor and servo
- Test basic movement
